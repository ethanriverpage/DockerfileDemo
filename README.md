### An example of building a Dockerfile and committing to the Docker Hub. See my Docker Hub profile [here!](https://hub.docker.com/u/ethanriverpage)
### This is a build on an example static site running NGINX & Alpine. [See Docker Hub repository here](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethanriverpage/my-website).
